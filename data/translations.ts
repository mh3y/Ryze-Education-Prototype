  // --- The Ryze Truth (Long Form) ---
  "The story behind why most tutoring fails, and how we fixed it.": "大多数补习失败背后的真相，以及我们如何改变这一现状。",
  "I Know This Because I've Lived It": "我深知这一点，因为我亲身经历过",
  "Parents rarely come to us at the beginning.": "家长们很少在一开始就找到我们。",
  "They come when they’re tired — and when their child is tired too.": "通常是当他们感到精疲力尽——孩子也感到厌倦时，才会来到这里。",
  "Before they reach Ryze, most families have already cycled through a handful of tutoring centres.": "在来到 Ryze 之前，大多数家庭已经辗转过好几家补习机构。",
  "They’ve paid the fees, done the weekly sessions, followed every recommendation.": "学费交了，课也上了，所有的建议都照做了。",
  "Months go by. The routines become familiar.": "几个月过去了，流程变得习以为常。",
  "But the understanding never really changes.": "但孩子对知识的理解，从未发生本质的改变。",
  "Meanwhile their child feels themselves slipping — comparing their progress to everyone else’s, wondering why they’re still stuck, wondering what’s wrong with them.": "与此同时，孩子感到自己在下滑——看着别人的进步，困惑自己为什么停滞不前，开始怀疑自己是不是有问题。",
  "And that’s the tragedy: not that the tutoring didn’t work, but that the child starts to believe <strong>they</strong> didn’t work.": "这才是真正的悲剧：不是补习没有效果，而是孩子开始相信<strong>自己</strong>不行。",
  "The truth is simpler and far less cruel.": "真相其实很简单，也没那么残酷。",
  "They were placed in environments that weren’t built to notice them — classrooms too crowded to see their confusion, too rigid to adapt to their pace, too busy to hear their questions.": "他们只是被置于一个无法“看见”他们的环境中——教室太拥挤而看不见他们的困惑，太僵化而无法适应他们的节奏，太忙碌而听不到他们的问题。",
  "Nothing was wrong with them.": "孩子没有问题。",
  "Something was wrong with the setup around them.": "有问题的是他们所处的环境。",
  "I still remember the feeling.": "那种感觉，至今令我难以忘怀。",
  "Packing my bag after school, that weight settling in my chest. Not the weight of textbooks — the weight of knowing where I was headed next.": "放学后收拾书包，那种沉重感压在心头。那不是书本的重量，而是对接下来要去的地方的恐惧。",
  "The bus ride to tutoring. Twenty minutes of dread.": "通往补习班的巴士车程。那是二十分钟的煎熬。",
  "I’d walk into that centre and become invisible. Just another student in a room of twenty others, all of us sitting in rows, staring at a whiteboard while a tutor droned through problems like they were reading a script they’d memorised years ago.": "走进那个补习中心，我就成了透明人。二十多个学生挤在一个房间里，我是其中之一。我们排排坐，盯着白板，听着导师像念早已背熟的剧本一样枯燥地讲解题目。",
  "15 hours. Every week.": "每周，整整15个小时。",
  "I wasn’t learning. I was enduring.": "我不是在学习。我是在忍受。",
  "The tutor didn’t know my name. Didn’t notice when I zoned out. Didn’t see the confusion on my face when they skipped steps I didn’t understand. I was a seat filled, a number on their attendance sheet, revenue on their spreadsheet.": "导师不知道我的名字。没发现我什么时候走神了。没看到他在跳过我不懂的步骤时我脸上的困惑。我只是一个被填满的座位，考勤表上的一个数字，财务报表上的一笔收入。",
  "But the worst part wasn’t the boredom. It was the guilt.": "但最糟糕的不是无聊。是内疚。",
  "Sitting there, watching the clock, knowing my parents were paying for this. Knowing they worked hard for that money. Knowing they believed this was helping me. And feeling like I was the problem.": "坐在那里看着时钟，知道父母为此付了钱。知道那是他们的血汗钱。知道他们相信这能帮到我。而我却觉得自己是个累赘。",
  "Why am I falling behind when everyone else seems fine?": "为什么别人看起来都没事，只有我掉队了？",
  "Why can’t I just get this?": "为什么我就是听不懂？",
  "What’s wrong with me?": "我到底怎么了？",
  "I started to believe I wasn’t smart enough. That I wasn’t “a math person.” That maybe I just didn’t have what it took.": "我开始相信是我不够聪明。相信我天生不是“学数学的料”。也许我就是没有那个天分。",
  "The truth—the one I couldn’t see then—was simpler:": "而那个我当时看不清的真相，其实很简单：",
  "Nothing was wrong with me. Something was wrong with the environment.": "我没有问题。是环境出了问题。",
  "I wasn’t stupid. I wasn’t lazy. I just needed someone to actually see me, to notice where I was stuck, to teach in a way that made sense to <i>me</i>—not to some imaginary average student in the middle of the class.": "我不笨，也不懒。我只是需要有人真正“看见”我，发现我卡在哪里，用我能理解的方式教我——而不是对着假想中的“平均水平”讲课。",
  "That experience left me with a question: Why does so much tutoring fail to actually help?": "这段经历给我留下了一个疑问：为什么这么多补习班都无法真正帮到学生？",
  "Why Tutoring Fails": "为什么传统补习会失败",
  "The systemic issues we identified and solved.": "我们发现并解决了的系统性问题。",
  "Problem 1 - Misdiagnosis": "问题 1：诊断缺失",
  "Most tutoring treats symptoms, not causes. A student struggles with quadratic equations, so they get drilled on quadratics. But often the real issue is three years back—incomplete understanding of fractions or basic algebra. Without diagnosing the foundational gap, you're building on sand.": "大多数补习只治标不治本。学生不会解二次方程，就被强迫刷二次方程的题。但真正的问题往往在三年前——分数或基础代数没学好。不解决基础漏洞，就像在沙滩上盖楼。",
  "Problem 2 - Passive Learning": "问题 2：被动学习",
  "Sitting and watching someone solve problems doesn't create understanding. Real learning requires active struggle—attempting problems, making mistakes, getting immediate feedback, and trying again. Large classes default to passive learning because managing active learning for twenty different students simultaneously is nearly impossible.": "看着别人解题产生不了理解。真正的学习需要主动的挣扎——尝试、犯错、获得即时反馈、再尝试。大班授课默认是让学生被动听讲，因为同时管理20个学生的主动学习几乎是不可能的。",
  "Problem 3 - The Silence Problem": "问题 3：沉默陷阱",
  "Students don't ask questions in large groups. Not because they're shy, but because the social cost is high and the benefit is uncertain. Will the tutor actually help, or will they give a rushed explanation before moving on? In my old tutoring centre, I asked maybe three questions across six months.": "学生在大班里不提问。不是因为害羞，而是因为“社交成本”太高且收益不确定。导师真的会帮忙吗，还是敷衍两句就继续讲课？在我以前的补习班，六个月里我大概只问了三个问题。",
  "Problem 4 - Mismatched Pacing": "问题 4：节奏错位",
  "Every student needs a different pace. In large classes, tutors teach to the middle. Advanced students waste time. Struggling students get left behind. Almost no one gets what they actually need.": "每个学生的节奏都不同。在大班里，导师只能照顾“中间水平”。优秀的学生在浪费时间，落后的学生被越甩越远。几乎没人得到他们真正需要的。",
  "Why Small Groups Actually Work": "为什么小班教学才有效",
  "I’m not claiming small groups are magic. Bad teaching is bad teaching regardless of class size. But small groups enable something that large classes cannot: <span className=\"text-white font-bold\">adaptive, individualised teaching.</span>": "我不是说小班是魔法。教得烂就是教得烂，跟班级大小无关。但小班教学实现了一件大班做不到的事：<span className=\"text-white font-bold\">适应性、个性化的教学。</span>",
  "Real Diagnosis": "真实诊断",
  "I can assess each student individually. I can trace their confusion back to its source.": "我可以单独评估每个学生。我可以追溯他们困惑的源头。",
  "Active Learning": "主动学习",
  "I watch them work. I see where they hesitate. Then I intervene at exactly the right moment.": "我看着他们做题。我能看到他们在哪里犹豫。然后在最恰当的时机介入指导。",
  "Questions Answered": "有问必答",
  "Asking questions feels normal. I can give thorough answers without others sitting idle.": "提问变得很自然。我可以详细解答，而不会浪费其他学生的时间。",
  "Flexible Pacing": "灵活节奏",
  "I can adjust the speed for each student. If someone needs more time, they get it.": "我可以为每个学生调整速度。如果谁需要更多时间，我就给。",
  "The Cost of Quality": "品质的成本",
  "I need to be direct about pricing: small group tutoring costs more than large classes.": "关于价格，我必须直言不讳：小班补习的成本确实比大班高。",
  "Here’s why: If I’m teaching six students instead of twenty, I need to charge more per student to make the business viable. That’s basic math.": "原因很简单：如果我只教6个学生而不是20个，为了维持运营，分摊到每个学生的费用自然会更高。这是基本的数学题。",
  "We charge what we do because that’s what it costs to pay qualified tutors properly, maintain quality facilities, and limit class sizes to six students maximum.": "我们的定价反映了我们要支付给优秀导师的合理薪酬、维持高质量设施以及严格将班级人数限制在6人以下的成本。",
  "This isn’t for everyone. If cost is your primary constraint, large group tutoring might be better. But if you’re looking for something that actually works — then the higher price reflects the actual value: individualised attention that produces results.": "这并不适合所有人。如果费用是您的首要考量，大班补习可能更合适。但如果您在寻找真正有效的方法——那么这个价格反映的是真实的价值：能带来成果的个性化关注。",
  "The Real Question": "真正的问题",
  "The question isn’t whether small groups are better than large groups in some abstract sense.": "问题不在于理论上小班是否比大班好。",
  "The question is: <span className=\"font-bold underline decoration-ryze decoration-4 underline-offset-4\">has what you’re currently doing worked?</span>": "真正的问题是：<span className=\"font-bold underline decoration-ryze decoration-4 underline-offset-4\">您现在的做法有效吗？</span>",
  "If your child has been attending tutoring for months and nothing has changed, then something about that environment isn’t working for them.": "如果您孩子补习了几个月却毫无起色，那说明那个环境并不适合他们。",
  "Maybe they need individual diagnosis. Maybe they need space to ask questions. Maybe they need a different pace.": "也许他们需要个别诊断。也许他们需要提问的空间。也许他们需要不同的节奏。",
  "If it works, continue. If it doesn’t, at least you’ll know.": "如果有效，就继续。如果无效，至少您试过了，心里有数。",

  "Most people think hiring someone to help with current struggles is enough.": "大多数人认为找个人解决当下的难题就够了。",
  "Reality": "残酷现实",
  "When tutoring is done right, it's <strong>systematic skill-building</strong>. A student struggling with fractions in Year 5 often has gaps from Year 2. By Year 7, that gap snowballs into algebra struggles.": "真正有效的补习是<strong>系统的技能构建</strong>。一个五年级分数不好的学生，往往二年级就有漏洞。到了七年级，这个漏洞会滚雪球般演变成代数的噩梦。",

  "Meet Them Where They Are": "因材施教",
  "Different students need different representations. We match the teaching to the student, not the other way around.": "不同的学生需要不同的讲解方式。我们让教学适应学生，而不是让学生适应教学。",
  "Explicit Instruction First": "清晰的指导先行",
  "Students need to be shown and taught first. Success breeds confidence, not confusion.": "学生需要先被教导和演示。成功孕育自信，而困惑只会带来焦虑。",
  "Build Confidence, Not Anxiety": "建立自信，而非焦虑",
  "We sequence lessons in small, manageable steps. Confusion is a barrier to learning, not a feature of it.": "我们将课程分解为小的、可管理的步骤。困惑是学习的障碍，而不是学习的一部分。",

  "How is Ryze different from other tutoring centres?": "Ryze 与其他补习中心有何不同？",
  "The biggest difference is our class size and teaching philosophy. Unlike major centres that host lecture-style classes with 20+ students, we cap every class at 6 students. This allows our tutors to actually know your child, identify their specific gaps, and provide the individual attention usually reserved for private tutoring, but within a collaborative small-group environment.": "最大的区别在于班级规模和教学理念。不同于那些20多人大班授课的机构，我们将每班人数严格限制在6人。这让导师能真正了解您的孩子，识别他们的具体差距，并在协作的小组环境中提供通常只有私教才有的个性化关注。",
  "Where are classes held?": "上课地点在哪里？",
  "Our campus classes are held at our dedicated centre in Sydney. We also offer high-definition online classes via Zoom/Teams for students who prefer to learn from home. Both formats maintain the strict 6-student cap to ensure quality.": "我们的面授课程在悉尼的专用中心进行。我们也为喜欢在家学习的学生提供高清在线课程。两种形式都严格保持6人上限以确保质量。",
  "Who are the tutors?": "导师是谁？",
  "Our team consists of NSW-accredited teachers, PhD candidates, and high-achieving university graduates. We don't just hire based on ATAR; we look for communication skills and emotional intelligence. All tutors undergo our specific training on the 'Ryze Method' of diagnostic teaching.": "我们的团队由新州认证教师、博士候选人和优秀的大学毕业生组成。我们不仅仅看重 ATAR 分数，更看重沟通能力和情商。所有导师都接受过我们特定的“Ryze 诊断式教学法”培训。",
  "What happens if my child misses a lesson?": "如果孩子缺课怎么办？",
  "We understand that life happens. If a student misses a class, they can access a recording of the lesson via the Student Portal. All materials, homework, and notes are also available digitally so they can catch up before the next session.": "我们理解生活中总有意外。如果学生缺课，可以通过学员门户观看课程录像。所有教材、作业和笔记也都提供电子版，以便他们在下次上课前补上。",
  "Is there homework?": "有作业吗？",
  "Yes. Mastery requires practice. We assign targeted homework each week to consolidate what was learnt in class. However, we focus on quality over quantity—we don't believe in busy work. Homework is marked with feedback provided to help students improve.": "有。精通需要练习。我们每周布置针对性作业以巩固课上所学。但我们重质不重量——我们不相信题海战术。作业会有批改和反馈，帮助学生改进。",
  "Do you follow the school curriculum?": "你们遵循学校的教学大纲吗？",
  "Absolutely. Our programs are strictly aligned with the NSW Syllabus (NESA). For our Year 11 and 12 courses, we are laser-focused on HSC requirements to ensure students maximize their internal ranks and final exam results.": "当然。我们的课程严格对齐新州教学大纲 (NESA)。对于11和12年级课程，我们专注于 HSC 要求，确保学生最大化校内排名和最终考试成绩。",
  "Do you offer trial lessons?": "提供试听课吗？",
  "Yes! We believe you should experience the difference before committing. We offer a paid trial lesson which is fully refundable if you decide not to continue. This allows your child to meet the tutor and see if our small-group dynamic is the right fit.": "是的！我们认为您应该在承诺之前体验不同之处。我们提供付费试听课，如果您决定不继续，费用可全额退还。这让您的孩子有机会见到导师，看看我们的小组氛围是否适合。",
  "Are there lock-in contracts?": "有锁定合同吗？",
  "No. We operate on a term-by-term basis. While most students stay with us for years, you are not locked into long-term contracts. We believe our results should be the reason you stay, not a contract.": "没有。我们按学期收费。虽然大多数学生会在我们这里学好几年，但您不会被长期合同锁定。我们相信留住您的应该是我们的教学成果，而不是合同。",
  "How do payments work?": "如何支付？",
  "We offer both quarterly (term) and monthly payment options to suit your budget. Invoices are sent via email and can be paid securely online via credit card or direct debit.": "我们提供季度（学期）和月付选项以适应您的预算。发票通过电子邮件发送，可以通过信用卡或直接借记安全在线支付。",
  "Are materials included in the fee?": "费用包含教材吗？",
  "Yes. All course fees cover the cost of our proprietary theory books, workbooks, and access to the Ryze AI online platform. There are no hidden resource fees.": "是的。所有课程费用包含我们专有的理论书、练习册以及 Ryze AI 在线平台的访问权。没有隐藏的资源费。",
